# WinNUKE
Started playing with the "Low Orbit Ion Cannon" Source code xP Wanted to remove all the skiddie stuff that comes with it and make it a respectable looking DDoS / Networking stress testing tool, as we all know Windows lacks in this department. Might add an option for pre loaded CFG and maybe try to run it as a system service etc. ‪#‎WinNUKEv1‬
